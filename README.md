# SCAPEgoat

SCAPEgoat addresses issues in existing toolkits used the entire SCA chain through simple file structures, support for standard capture hardware, and a post-processing software suite. The idea behind the design of SCAPEgoat (SCA with high Performance Evaluation + WPI's mascot that is a goat) is to create modules corresponding to (virtually all) steps taken in SCA. The modular nature of SCAPEgoat enables the user to enjoy each module separately or as a complete framework. 
Moreover, SCAPEgoat introduces memory efficiency, especially regarding RAM usage for large datasets, making our tool ideal for newcomers.
